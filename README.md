## RNN Mathematical Understand 
<p> Understanding notation of algorithm, specially in deep learning is important to understand things in broadly. 
When we read research paper, then we can see this things, he add not all but need to know basis math, so it's good to know the natation math. Or it's say that **Make familirity with Natation or Notation language** </p>
